# nba-api

This is a free API that is built in `<node.js>`, that is based in a free library that provides two API's, check them in the [link](`https://github.com/kashav/nba.js).
Our API is more simple to use than the others mentioned above and our main goal is to make life easier for anyone who wants use it.
Check our [API documentation here]! (docs\DOCUMENTATION.md)
