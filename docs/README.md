# nba-api

This is a free API that is built in `<node.js>`, it is based in two APIs, check them in the [link](`https://github.com/kashav/nba.js`).
* data.nba.net
* stats.nba.com

My API is more simple to use than the others mentioned above and our main goal is to make life easier for anyone who wants use it.
Check our documentation [here](`docs\DOCUMENTATION.md`) for a use guide! 

I'm also developing an website to provide a user interface with historical NBA stats, scores, teams, players and more.
Check it out!

Any suggestion feel free to contact me.
