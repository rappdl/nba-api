# nba-api

This is a free API that is built-in `<node.js>`, which is based in a free library that provides two APIs, check them in the [link](`https://github.com/kashav/nba.js).
Our API is more simple to use than the others mentioned above and our main goal is to make life easier for anyone who wants to use it.
Check our [API documentation here]! (docs\DOCUMENTATION.md)

We also developed a website that provides a user interface with historical NBA stats, scores, teams, players and more.

Any suggestions feel free to contact us.
